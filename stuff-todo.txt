	#1
		HathLibraries.DataTypes.HttpServerCmd request validations.
			For reference use java source.
			Validation should be done in:
				HathServer.HandleClient line 110 ( inside 'case "servercmd":' )


	#2
		Fix: 'Log.Trigger.HttpRequestReceived()'
			Variable 'unixtime' is sometimes set to '0' which causes Out of range exceptions.
